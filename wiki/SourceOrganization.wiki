== Source organization ==
  * *trunk/*: _stable_ branch, check out this!
    * *aprofplot/*: a java GUI for displaying aprof logs
    * *benchmark/*: some tools/code used for aprof's benchmarks
    * *valgrind/*: [http://valgrind.org/ snapshot of valgrind code]
       * *aprof/*: source code of aprof
       * *tf/*: source code of TF, basic logic of callgrind for tracing fuunctions, very limited (no multithreading, no signal handling, only correct under `x86/x86_64`), very ineficient
  * *tags/vg1*: first implementation of aprof under Valgrind, traces functions only through GCC instrumentation (`-finstrument-functions`), deprecated
