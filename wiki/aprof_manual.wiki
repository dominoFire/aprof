aprof is a [http://valgrind.org/ Valgrind] tool. You can find a more [http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual.html general user manual] about this binary instrumentation framework on its official site.

`--memory-resolution=<k> [default: 4]`

  To reduce the space needed by the shadow memory, `aprof` allows users to configure the resolution of distinct observable memory objects, trading space for accuracy. This can potentially impact the number of distinct RMS values observed by `aprof`, and therefore the number of collected performance tuples. We denote by k the size in bytes of the smallest observable objects, which we assume to be aligned to addresses multiple of k. For k = 1, we have the finest resolution, shadowing the addresses of all accessed individual memory bytes. For k = 2, we trace accesses to 2-bytes words aligned at 16-bit boundaries, halving the universe of timestamps. The larger k, the smaller the RMS accuracy for routines working on small objects (e.g., strings of characters)
and the smaller the size of the shadow memory. 
  Possible valid values are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.
