=== Download ===
You can download release 0.1 from the [http://code.google.com/p/aprof/downloads/list download section]. If you want the latest version, you can download it from the SVN:
{{{
svn checkout http://aprof.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/aprofplot aprofplot
}}}

JCommon, JFreeChart and RSyntaxTextArea are required by aprofplot; they are included in the aprofplot code repository (under `aprofplot/lib`).

In order to use the source code browsing function, you need to have installed on your system a recent version of [http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ ctags]. 

==== ctags on Mac OS X ====
For example, on Mac OS X, you can download a recent binary (dmg) of ctags [http://code.google.com/p/rudix/downloads/detail?name=ctags-5.8-1.dmg&can=2&q=label%3ARudix-2011 here]. Then you need to set in aprof-plot `exuberant-ctags` as ctags binary (see below).

=== Set ctags binary path ===
aprof-plot need to know where ctags is installed on your system. By default, it will search ctags as `ctags-exuberant`. If your ctags has another name, you can set the right name (or the right path) in _aprof-plot > edit > settings > Tools > ctags binary_.
