#summary aprof's user guide

== Introduction ==

This project includes two main tools:

  * `aprof` is a [http://valgrind.org/ Valgrind] tool for performance profiling designed to help developers discover hidden asymptotic inefficiencies in the code. From a single run of a program, aprof measures how the performance of individual routines scales as a function of the input size, yielding clues to its growth rate and to the [http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/bigOnotation.html "big-O"] of the program. *See the [aprof_manual user manual]*

  * `aprof-plot`  is a Java graphical user interface for visualizing reports generated by `aprof`. *See the [aprof_plot_manual user manual]*
