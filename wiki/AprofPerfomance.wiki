Benchmarks:
  * [DSP]: an experimental evaluation of dynamic all pairs shortest path algorithms
  * [SPEC2006 SPEC CPU 2006]: [http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/ CPU2006] is SPEC's next-generation, industry-standardized, CPU-intensive benchmark suite, stressing a system's processor, memory subsystem and compiler. SPEC designed CPU2006 to provide a comparative measure of compute-intensive performance across the widest practical range of hardware using workloads developed from real user applications.
