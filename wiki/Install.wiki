#summary Instructions for installing aprof and aprof-plot

=== Install aprof ===

Currently, aprof does not ship with Valgrind, so you have to download it from our svn repository:
{{{
svn checkout http://aprof.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/valgrind aprof_valgrind
}}}

To compile it (automake tools are needed):
{{{
cd aprof_valgrind
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=`pwd`/inst
make
}}}
the downloaded repository includes Valgrind 3.7.0 - svn rev. 12556. Using the `--prefix` param of the `configure` command we avoid any collision with other installations of Valgrind in your system. aprof will be installed locally under the `aprof_valgrind/inst` directory. You can install it with:
{{{
make install
}}}

If you are on an ARM/PPC architecture please read [AprofOnARM_PPC this] first.


=== Install aprof-plot ===

You can download the latest release of aprof-plot from the [http://code.google.com/p/aprof/downloads/list download section]. 

If you want to try the latest version, you can download it from SVN:
{{{
svn checkout http://aprof.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/aprofplot aprofplot
}}}

JCommon, JFreeChart and RSyntaxTextArea are required by aprofplot; they are included in the aprofplot code repository (under `aprofplot/lib`).

In order to use the source code browsing function, you need to have installed on your system a recent version of [http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ ctags]. 

==== ctags on Mac OS X ====

For example, on Mac OS X, you can download a recent binary (dmg) of ctags [http://code.google.com/p/rudix/downloads/detail?name=ctags-5.8-1.dmg&can=2&q=label%3ARudix-2011 here]. Then you need to set in aprof-plot `/usr/local/bin/exuberant-ctags` as ctags binary (see below).

To make the jar file, run the following commands:

{{{
cd aprofplot
ant
}}}
