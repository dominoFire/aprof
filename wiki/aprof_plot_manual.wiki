An Input-Sensitive profiler produces large amounts of information. As increasingly more detailed profiles are collected by `aprof`, the information conveyed to a user is quickly become overwhelming.

`aprof-plot` is an interactive graphical viewer written in Java for visualizing performance profiles generated by `aprof`. It can support programmers in the task of finding hidden asymptotic bottlenecks in their code, characterizing the workload and behavior of individual routines in the context of real applications.

== Run aprof-plot ==

See the [BasicUsage#Visualize_profile_reports basic usage page].

== User interface overview ==

After starting `aprof-plot` and loading a report generated by `aprof` we should see something like this:

We can identify four main core graphical components:

We have:

 * component 1: the [aprof_plot_manual#Charts charts's area], several charts are shown based on the selected routine
 * component 2: the [aprof_plot_manual#Routine_table routine table], a list of all profiled routines of our program
 * component 3: the [aprof_plot_manual#Routine_profile routine profile], a list of all collected performance tuples for the selected routine
 * component 4: the [aprof_plot_manual#Main_menu_&_toolbar menubar and toolbar]

Let's discuss in details all aspects and features of `aprof-plot`.
