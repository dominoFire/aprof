= Sort algorithms =
See algorithms used [http://code.google.com/p/aprof/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fbenchmark%2Ftests%2Fsort here]. We run each algorithm with both metric (time: RDTSC, instruction: BB executed).
== Bubble sort ==
Asymptotic complexity: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort O(n^2^)] 

== Heap sort ==
Asymptotic complexity: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort O(n*log(n))]

== Integer sort ==
Asymptotic complexity: O(n)

== Merge sort ==
Asymptotic complexity: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort O(n*log(n))]

== Quick sort ==
Asymptotic complexity: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort O(n^2^)]
