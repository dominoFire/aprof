= Sort algorithms =
See algorithms used [http://code.google.com/p/aprof/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fbenchmark%2Ftests%2Fsort here]. We run each algorithm with both metric (time: RDTSC, instruction: BB executed).
== Bubble sort ==
Asymptotic complexity: O(n^2^) ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort ref]) 

== Heap sort ==
Asymptotic complexity: O(n*log(n)) ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort ref])

== Integer sort ==
Asymptotic complexity: O(n)

== Merge sort ==
Asymptotic complexity: O(n*log(n)) ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort ref])

== Quick sort ==
Asymptotic complexity:  O(n^2^) ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort ref]) <br>
Average perfomance: O(n*log(n))

== Selection sort ==
Asymptotic complexity: O(n^2^) ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort ref])
